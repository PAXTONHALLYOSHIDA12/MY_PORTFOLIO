            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Spandan K, a passionate data science and machine learning enthusiast. I love engaging in debates, Model United Nations (MUN), and discussing geopolitics. My goal is to combine my analytical skills with my love for political ideologies, breaking down news and propaganda with a foundation in economic analysis and factual statistics.</p>
            <p>I am currently studying at Symbiosis International University, constantly striving to learn more and push boundaries in my field. I believe in the power of data to uncover truths and drive decisions. Feel free to explore my projects to see the work I have been doing!</p>
            <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy engaging in meaningful discussions that challenge conventional thinking and explore new perspectives. I believe that the intersection of data science and social issues holds immense potential for shaping the future. I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate and contribute to projects that aim to make a positive impact on society.</p>
